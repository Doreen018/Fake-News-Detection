# Fake-News-Detection
Fake news involves the transimition of false information through social medial channels and other online platforms to mislead people. This projects explores a classification model that predicts the 'fakeness' and 'realness' of a dataset. The project explores the use of PassiveAggressiveClassifier to classify the provided data set, a confusion matrix to measure the display the results of the model and measure its accuracy, and a classification report that details the preciseness of the model using accuracy, precisio, recall, f1-score and support measures.
